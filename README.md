# 🚆 Train Consist Management App

## 📌 Overview
The **Train Consist Management App** is a console-based Java application that simulates how railway systems manage a train’s consist — the sequence of bogies attached to an engine.

This project demonstrates **Core Java, Data Structures, Streams, Regex, and OOP concepts** through real-world railway scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Manage passenger and goods bogies
- Track seating and load capacities
- Ensure uniqueness of bogies
- Maintain train formation order
- Map bogies to operational attributes
- Sort bogies based on capacity
- Filter and group bogies using Streams
- Calculate total seating capacity
- Validate Train ID and Cargo Codes using Regex
- Enforce safety compliance rules for goods bogies

## 🏗️ Concepts Covered

| Use Case | Concept |
|----------|--------|
| UC1 | Application setup, ArrayList initialization |
| UC2 | ArrayList operations (add, remove, contains) |
| UC3 | HashSet (uniqueness) |
| UC4 | OOP (Bogie class, objects) |
| UC5 | LinkedHashSet (order + uniqueness) |
| UC6 | HashMap (key-value mapping) |
| UC7 | Comparator (custom sorting) |
| UC8 | Stream API – filter() |
| UC9 | Stream API – groupingBy() |
| UC10 | Stream API – map() + reduce() |
| UC11 | Regex validation (Pattern & Matcher) |
| UC12 | Stream API – allMatch() (safety compliance) |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open project in IntelliJ / Eclipse  
2. Navigate to:

App/src/TrainConsistManagement.java

3. Right-click → Run  

OR using terminal:

```bash
javac TrainConsistManagement.java
java TrainConsistManagement
🧪 Sample Functionalities
✅ Add Passenger Bogies
Sleeper
AC Chair
First Class
✅ Ensure Unique Bogies
Duplicate bogies automatically ignored using HashSet
✅ Maintain Order
Train formation preserved using LinkedHashSet
✅ Map Capacity
Sleeper → 72
AC Chair → 50
First Class → 30
✅ Sort Bogies
Sorted using Comparator based on capacity
✅ Filter Bogies (UC8)
Display bogies with capacity > threshold using filter()
✅ Group Bogies (UC9)
Group by type using groupingBy()
✅ Total Capacity (UC10)
Calculate total seats using map() + reduce()
✅ Regex Validation (UC11)
Train ID → TRN-1234
Cargo Code → PET-AB
✅ Safety Compliance (UC12)
Cylindrical bogies must carry Petroleum only
Validated using allMatch()
📊 Sample Output
=== Train Consist Management App ===

All Bogies:
Sleeper (Capacity: 72)
AC Chair (Capacity: 50)
First Class (Capacity: 30)

Total Seating Capacity: 152

Grouped Bogies:
Sleeper → [Sleeper (Capacity: 72)]
AC Chair → [AC Chair (Capacity: 50)]

Train ID is VALID
Cargo Code is VALID

Train is SAFETY COMPLIANT
